## Time Interval Cumulation Visuzalizations:

In this mini-project, I use p5.js to generate visualizations to illustrate various time-hacks and time-based philosophies that I adhere to. This can be boiled down to adhering to one single rule:

**The maximal cumulation of high-value time intervals in ones day-to-day life should be strived for, every day.**

Philosophy and pontification aside, it is better to illustrate the benefits and effects of such rule (and its implications on ones life) by using 2-D visualizations. 

Each visualization will be modularized its own js script file, and loaded in sequence on a simple HTML page.
